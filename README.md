## Mini twitter

My project consists of two pages: the home page and the main page.

On the home page, we can see the total number of users, and by clicking a button, we can navigate to the main page.

On the main page, we have a button to go back to the home page. We can see cards of all the users, and we have the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from them. The "Load More" button fetches an additional 3 user cards each time it is clicked. At the top of the screen, we have a filtering option: "All Users," "Follow" and "Following"
